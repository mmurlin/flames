# flames

A cute simulation of fire, with a curses front-end just for your terminal.

My interpretation of [this gist](https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096950#file-cfire)
from GitHub user msimpson.

The actual logic for the fireyness is split into `boards.flameboard`, so in
theory you could extend this for your own choice of front-end if curses isn't
your style.

# Usage

`python flames.py`
